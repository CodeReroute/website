          There are no effective direct-to-customer marketing platforms in the
          restaurant industry. Currently, restaurants advertise on large social
          media platforms such as Meta, TikTok and X. This is a problem because
          audiences are broad and there is lack of clarity about ad
          click-through rates and conversions (ie. how many people came to the
          restaurant after seeing an online ad).
        </p>
        <p className={styles['product-middle-section-paragraph-2']}>
          Clearly, videos featuring food and restaurants is a popular genre
          across all existing social media platforms but the user journey ends
          when the video is over.
        </p>
        <p className={styles['product-middle-section-paragraph-3']}>
          We‚Äôve seen applications built for online reservations and applications
          built for restaurant discovery but they lack a thriving ecosystem of
          engaged users.
